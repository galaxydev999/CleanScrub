            <h1>Deep Cleaning Package</h1>

            <p>Your home is where you should be the most comfortable, and nobody wants to live in a home that
                isn’t
                as clean as it could be. However, more important things in life fill up your schedule, and over
                time, grime, grease, and dust build up around the house.

            </p>

            <p>Do you have cobwebs in the corner, or dust covering shelves so thickly that it’s a different
                color?
            </p>

            <p>Are your cabinets covered with greasy fingerprints, or your stove covered with splatters?
            </p>

            <p>Do you have grime in your tubs and showers?
            </p>

            <p>Is mold starting to grow between tiles, glass doors opaque with soap residue build-up?
            </p>

            <p>Do your pets shed incessantly and their hair covers your floors, couches, and rugs?
            </p>

            <p>Do you have young kids (enough said, right?)?
            </p>

            <p>Besides all the obvious details, there are some parts of your house you just can’t reach or don’t
                have the time to
                carefully clean in your busy schedule – high bookshelves, intake vents, fan blades, picture
                frames,
                under
                lampshades, window blinds, dirty baseboards, and more! When your home needs a truly deep and
                thorough clean, it’s
                best to trust a professional cleaning service.
            </p>

            <p>At Cleanscrub.ng, performing a deep house cleaning doesn’t only mean wiping down surfaces and scrubbing
                sinks. We believe that the best cleaning services provide a thorough, well-defined experience and attend
                to the little details. We use a personalized approach in all of our cleaning services to make your home,
                office and event center cleaner than you have imagined it could be.</p>

            <h1>When to purchase our Deep Cleaning Package:</h1>




            <p>Note: Please have painters remove all tape from hinges and hardware before final clean. We can
                remove
                plastic film from cabinets but as it is a tedious job, we will charge extra.
            </p>

            <h1>First-Time Service</h1>
            <p>The first time your home is cleaned is incredibly important. Prior to beginning recurring service with
                us, we can provide your very first cleaning as a Deep Cleaning Package. This will bring your house to
                the best possible cleanliness level – and keeping it that way will be easy to accomplish once recurring
                services are started. This is especially important if your home hasn’t been cleaned before, or if the
                condition of the home is very “lived-in”.</p>

            <h1>One-Time Service
            </h1>

            <p>Sometimes, a single, Deep Cleaning Package is enough to make your house as clean as you want or need.
                When would you
                need a one-time deep cleaning service?
            </p>
