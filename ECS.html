            <h1>Economy Cleaning Package: </h1>

            <p>After getting a First Time Premium Deep cleaning package, using our Economy Cleaning Package for Weekly,
                Biweekly, or Monthly services can keep your home at maintenance level with minimum cost to you. This
                package is designed for those with low-maintenance homes or those on a budget who still want the basics
                taken care of. Maybe you only have 2 or fewer residents, or you are just a very tidy person who can take
                care of most cleaning aspects of the home, but still need some help. If your main concerns are
                bathrooms, kitchens, and floors, and your home doesn’t need a lot of detail dusting and cleaning on a
                regular basis, consider this low-cost option.
