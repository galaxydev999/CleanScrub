                        Every time we clean your home or office, we will do “the little things” that most cleaning
                        services
                        miss. These small, seemingly insignificant details are sometimes the most important in
                        maintaining a
                        truly clean house. These include moving small plants, furniture, and appliances while
                        cleaning,
                        straightening pictures after dusting, dusting light fixtures and baseboards, dusting all
                        reachable
                        corners of the house, and more. In treating your home as we would our own, we can guarantee
                        that
                        the
                        little things will be covered and you will be left with the cleanest house you have seen in
                        a
                        long time.
